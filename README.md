This is a learning project on Proto Actor + gRPC + Angular 5. 

Status: Proof of concept **unstable** and needs **a lot** of cleanup

**USE AT YOUR OWN RISK**

To interact with Sherlock you can use the c# Sherlock client or your own stuff (https://github.com/ProximoSrl/Sherlock/blob/develop/src/Sherlock/Services/Sherlock.proto)
